## [Demo Site](alltrell-films.surge.sh)

## Essential Information

An internet movie search engine using The Movie Database API, along with AngularJS and Angular UI Router, a third party module for routing on SPAs, and, of course, HTML/CSS. Our first use of an external API, we spent a small amount of time testing out various queries in Postman so that we could understand exactly how the information would be returned to us, and thus how to display it through the HTML.
