# Movie Search Engine

An internet movie search engine using The Movie Database API, along with AngularJS and Angular UI Router, a third party module for routing on SPAs. Our first use of an external API, we spent a small amount of time testing out various queries in Postman so that we could understand exactly how the information would be returned to us, and thus how to display it through the HTML.

## Usage

It's pretty straightforward to use, and can be accessed via this [link](alltrell-films.surge.sh). Bugs and errors make themselves apparent from time to time, and will be updated in the future.
